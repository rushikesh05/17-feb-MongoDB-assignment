        "\n",
        "* MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format. Because it is a non-relational database, it does not use tables or join operations to store data. Instead, it stores data in flexible semi-structured documents that can be nested and have different fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
        "* Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. Instead, they use different data models, such as document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based models. Non-relational databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, which can be challenging to manage in a traditional relational database.\n",
        "\n",
        "* MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, and the schema is not fixed or predictable. For example, social media websites, content management systems, and big data applications generate vast amounts of unstructured data that can be efficiently managed using MongoDB. MongoDB's flexible data model also makes it well-suited for agile development, where the schema is expected to change frequently during the development process.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Additionally, MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it suitable for applications that require high availability and scalability. It also supports sharding, which allows the database to partition data across multiple servers to improve performance and handle larger datasets."

        "\n",
        "####MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used for building scalable and flexible applications. Here are some of its key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This makes it easy to represent complex hierarchical relationships between data and makes it easier to map to object-oriented programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Schema-less: MongoDB is schema-less, which means that you don't need to define a fixed schema before storing data. This makes it very easy to store and retrieve data without worrying about the database schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Scalable: MongoDB is designed to be scalable, both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal scaling means adding more servers to handle increased load, while vertical scaling means increasing the resources of a single server. MongoDB can be scaled to handle millions of operations per second.\n",
        "\n",
        "* High Availability: MongoDB supports high availability through replica sets, which are groups of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. If one server fails, another server in the replica set can take over, ensuring that the system remains available.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flexible Querying: MongoDB has a powerful querying language that allows you to perform complex queries on your data. It supports a wide range of operators and functions, making it easy to query data in a variety of ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing, which allows you to quickly search and retrieve data based on specific criteria. You can create indexes on any field in a document, making it easy to optimize your queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding, which allows you to partition your data across multiple servers. This allows you to scale your database horizontally, ensuring that your system can handle the increased load.\n"
